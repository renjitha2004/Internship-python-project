This repository contains a collection of Python projects completed during my internship, covering core topics in data science, machine learning, and deep learning. The work includes data preprocessing tasks such as outlier detection, data cleaning, and feature transformation; machine learning model implementation with a multinomial classifier; numerical computing exercises using NumPy for array operations and matrix manipulation; and introductory deep learning tasks using PyTorch, including tensor operations, neural network fundamentals, and training workflows. These files collectively demonstrate practical hands-on experience with real-world data handling, model development, and foundational deep learning concepts.
